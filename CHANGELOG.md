# Changelog

All notable changes to Aalaapi Sky will be documented in this file.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **DJI RC2/WPML Compatibility:** Fixed waypoint flight load/execution error on DJI RC2 controllers when hitting "Go" by removing the unsupported `<wpml:payloadInfo>` block from generated KML/WPML flight plans.
- **Security:** Resolved multiple stored and DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in weather data UI panel rendering, waypoint warning displays, and map legend rendering.

### Added
- **Documentation:** Updated the RC2 Waypoint File Injection Guide in the UI modal to provide clear instructions for unzipping and copying multipart ZIP split-mission exports.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **DJI RC2/WPML Compatibility:** Fixed waypoint flight execution/import errors by resetting `actionGroupId` locally within each waypoint Placemark folder and appending the required `useGlobalPayloadLensIndex` to `takePhoto` and `startRecord` action parameters. Stripped out deprecated `fileSuffix` tags to match strict DJI RC2 controller firmware schemas.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Useful Links Button:** Added quick access to aviation and FAA tools directly in the header modal (IACRA, FAADroneZone, METAR, TFR, NOTAM).

### Added
- **Map Layers:** Topography base map, FAA Obstacles overlay, and HIFLD Power Lines transmission layer (active at zoom 11+).
